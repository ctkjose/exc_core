Use a state for a server to

- add includes
- add a controller as JS code
- interactions


Controller Loading

When app controller is loading, all other controllers already loaded will wait for the app to initialize before getting their `initialize` call.
If a controller is loaded after the app is running, the `initialize` will be called right away, this controller will not wait for other controllers added by its own manifest.


self.app = {
	manifest: {
			includes: [
				{url: "test1.js", wait: true},
				{url: "../css/test1.css"}
			]
	}


};

core.ready(function(){

	app

});
